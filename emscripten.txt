Buidling


cd into emsdk
emsdk_env.bat
cd into the project directory

mkdir build
// Calling it inside the build folder so the build files won't be placed into the source directories. This is call an out of source build.
cd build 

// On the first build run
emcmake cmake .. -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5
// After that to build use
ninja

// -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 is added, because qhull uses minimum version 3.0 which is deprecated and the project won't build without it.


To run a local http server can use
python -m http.server

To build in release mode use the normal release mode option in cmake when calling emcmake.
