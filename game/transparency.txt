Weighted blended OIT doesn't work well, because it can't handle surfaces with opacity equal or near 1.
This is described and shown here: https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2014/02/03/weighted-blended-oit/
Bullets and visual effects should be visible to the player, but might have some transparent parts.
So I would have to make these things fully opaque and use OIT only for the surface to handle cases of self overlap like the klein bottle.

The only real solutions seems to be:
Use a single ubershader for all transparent things and just sort the triangles.
This would require a 
struct Vertex {
	Vec3 pos;
	i32 type;
	Vec2 uv;
}

Use depth peeling or some other technique that does per pixel sorting.

Could make the surface fully transparent and make it scaffold.
