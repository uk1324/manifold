Directed bullets, for example arrows might be more readable in complicated patterns.
Randomizing the angle or directing it at the player to remove blind spots.

Have multiple bullets with different velocities spawn at a point to have a nice spreading.

One issue with the torus is that most ofo the geodesics are not closed so things turn into a mess quicky. One way to deal with it might be to fade the bullets before that happens.

Could integrate the points as if they were on a flat torus. Might be good to use the conformal mapping for this.

Many twin stick shooters rely on enemies chasing you for creating the challange

To get noise on a sphere just use 3d noise and constrain it to a sphere.
