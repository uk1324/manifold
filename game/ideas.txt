Different tilings on surfaces

Using curves in parametric radial form.

SDF fade between tilings.

Directed bullets, for example arrows might be more readable in complicated patterns.
Randomizing the angle or directing it at the player to remove blind spots.

Have multiple bullets with different velocities spawn at a point to have a nice spreading.

One issue with the torus is that most ofo the geodesics are not closed so things turn into a mess quicky. One way to deal with it might be to fade the bullets before that happens.

Could integrate the points as if they were on a flat torus. Might be good to use the conformal mapping for this.

Many twin stick shooters rely on enemies chasing you for creating the challange

Dijkstra for spawning 

To get noise on a sphere just use 3d noise and constrain it to a sphere.

Conformal mapping of torus.
All conformal mappings of sphere.

The insometry on a sphere can be uniquely (up to sign) determined by 3 points. This theorem hold in general without the parallel postulate.
First determine the symmetry of the faces (just connected vertices to centroids). This will give the appropriate tiling.

Could do colorings of sphere. Could either just raytrace sphere and draw curves on it like this. Or raytrace the triangles and have a texture. Then based on the triangle you can get which isometry brings it back to the original and then uv map the texture 
For this also could do colorings. Some curves will be drawn with different colors.

Rendering system for oit. And rendering curves.

Drawing Caley graphs.

If you have a laser in a triangle (or 2 angle, like the ones on the sphere) that is part of some tiling the reflections inside it will produce closed curves. If the converse also true?
