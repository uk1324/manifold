If we have some curve regular curve a(t) such that |a'(t)| != 0
Then the length is a monotically increasing function so we can define a length based such that parametrization
a(t(s)) = b(s)
This parametrization will have |b'(s)| = 1.

Then the original curve a(t) = b(s(t)) so that
a'(t) = b'(s(t)) * s'(t)
|a'(t)| = |b'(s(t)) * s'(t)| = |b'(s(t))| * |s'(t)| = 1 * s'(t) = s'(t)
Which implies that 
a'(t)/|a'(t)| = b'(s(t)), which is the tangent of the unit speed parametrization.
So you don't need to compute the unit speed parametrization work with it's frenet frame.
